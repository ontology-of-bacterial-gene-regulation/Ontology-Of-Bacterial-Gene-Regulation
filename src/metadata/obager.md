The Ontology of Bacterial Gene Regulation (OBAGER) is an ontology developed to formally represent the concepts and relationships underlying bacterial gene regulation. It translates expert-reviewed definitions of promoters, transcription units, transcription factors, and related entities into formal OWL axioms, enabling logical consistency and future integration with FAIR data initiatives.

Unlike instance-based models, OBAGER focuses on TBox-level definitions: necessary and sufficient conditions are defined at the class level to capture our best current understanding of regulatory biology. These definitions are provisional but expert-informed, designed to be transparent and extensible as new biological evidence emerges.
