name: DNA region
def: "A nucleic acid region comprised of a continuous stretch of deoxyribonucleotide residues or base-pairs, extending along the linear axis of a multi-stranded DNA or a DNA strand, and representing a proper part of this larger molecular entity." []
comment: Includes regions of any DNA or DNA strand, including regions of single-stranded and multi-stranded DNAs, and regions of individual base-paired DNA strands. So a DNA region can be either a continuous stretch of deoxyribonucleotide residues along the linear axis of a single-stranded DNA or base-paired DNA strand, or a continuous stretch of base-pairs along the linear axis of a multi-stranded DNA.
