def: "A regulatory_region composed of the TSS(s) and binding sites for TF_complexes of the core transcription machinery. A region (DNA) to which RNA polymerase binds, to begin transcription." [SO:regcreative]
comment: This term is mapped to MGED. Do not obsolete without consulting MGED ontology. The region on a DNA molecule involved in RNA polymerase binding to initiate transcription. Moved from is_a: SO:0001055 transcriptional_cis_regulatory_region as per request from GREEKC initiative in August 2020. Merged with RNA_polymerase_promoter (SO:0001203) Aug 2020. Moved up one level from is_a CRM (SO:0000727) to is_a transcriptional_cis_regulatory_region (SO:0001055) as part of the GREEKC work January 2021. Pascale Gaudet from Gene Ontology pointed out that CRM can be located upstream of the promoter and therefore cannot include the promoter.
